# admin-portal-website

This is the administrator website for the location-based-notifications-using-amazon-pinpoint.

All backend and amplify references are configured once the solution is deployed using the CloudFormation.

If you want to run this web site locally, you will need to update the backend references inside the `src/aws-exports.js` file.

For more information about the backend services and resources, please check the solution implementation guide.
